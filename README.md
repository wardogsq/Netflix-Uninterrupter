Netflix-Uninterrupter
=====================

Prevent Netflix from Auto-pausing! Watch your shows uninterrupted the way they were meant to be.

I couldn't find any solution to prevent netflix from stopping and making me click buttons every so often so I created this small script to do it.



INSTALL
---------------------------
CHROME:  <strike>Just drag the file into the extension tab in chrome and it will auto install.</strike>Install  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en">TamperMonkey</a> from the chrome store create a new script in it and paste the contents of this script into it. It has to be installed through this app or chrome will declare it unsafe since it isn't from the appstore which costs money to host.

FIREFOX:  (Untested) Should be compatible with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey</a> extension, if not let me know in the comments and I'll make it compatible.
